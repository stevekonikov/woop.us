</dl><p>As a child, Drakas was known for being quite an engaged mind. In fact, you might call him an an &uuml;ber-geek although he really isn't one. That aside, he does make great use of computers and the internet and is pretty good at cooking. You'll see him bragging about how good something he just made tastes... and he'll eat it along with some noob meat too.</p>

<p>Drakas' first proper game was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>, which wasted much of his childhood on. Soon enough he was introduced to Quake 2, but did not take much interest in it, later encountering the fun Wolfenstein 3D. But in the later years, he found himself playing Unreal Tournament, where he was getting pretty much owned: it has a long history! At that point in time he was hooked on FPS. He advanced to Cube/Sauerbraten and Warsow soon enough. He also enjoyed playing Warsow, known as "Quake on weed".</p>

<p>In the days of old Sauerbraten, his competition was against rock.n.rol, sdk, nitronix, t0taln00b and others, some of the most famous players of the old days. In October 2006, Drakas, t0taln00b and Flapdrol, got together a team of those who want simply to pwn, because the clan competition was not big enough! That was when the "n00b-clan" was born. In a week's time, however, we renamed ourselves to the Woop clan, as we are today.</p>

<p>Drakas has spent a lot of time in managing this clan, managing (Fragfests and AC World Cup) and participating in various competitions (ESL, AC Cups) as well as running the <a href="http://hi-skill.us/">HI-SKILL ladder</a> for AssaultCube.</p>

</p><p>Behind the scenes Rhubarb is handy in the kitchen, rhubarb being the key
major ingredient in Rhubarb's signature dish.

</p><p>Rhubarb is also an excellent ingredient that can go into Dinner and
sweets. Which means there's never a meal that rhubarb can not be
included into. It's one of the 5 major food groups!

</p><p>Rhubarb likes to bathe in the w00p community, to chat about anything and

He learnt to frag on Doom, Heretic and later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, before quitting gaming to concentrate on his studies (or something...). After discovering Open Source, he returned to gaming with GNU/Linux and Sauerbraten.</p>
<p>With over a decade of fps experience, dazza has fragging figured out. While playing, he discovered a group of elite gamers calling themselves w00p; now an active w00p member for over 6 months, dazza loves to pit his will against the best gamers Sauerbraten has to offer, or relax after a tough day by putting noobs in their place in the public servers.</p>
<p>After suffering for some months on high-ping overseas servers, dazza used his linux experience to set up the w00p:au sauerbraten servers for low-ping fragging in the oceanic region. w00p continues to attract players from around australia with the promise of low latency and tough competition.</p>
<p>In between working as a software developer and sleeping, Dazza spends his time fragging noobs and maintaining half of w00p's server collection. Expect to find him in-game waiting for talented new players to frag :)</p>

</dl><p>"A tachyon (meaning "swift, fast") is any hypothetical particle that travels at superluminal velocity. --- Therefore, it can never slow to light speed or below." -- Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Tachyon doesn't have a decent gaming history. He mostly played chess, some logic games, and occasionally something along the lines of BSD games and nethack. In fact, he belives he could manage with a portable machine with a 17Mzh CPU and 256Kb RAM, if it weren't for AC and Sauerbraten.</p>
<p>Tachyon likes some Q3A/arcade-styled FPS games that are designed towards fun and skill. He also likes various real life strategy/board/role/logic/diplomacy games that require skill and are fun. After some intense practise and funny IRC-sessions (mostly later), he was not getting ownzored so much anymore, he was a Woopie.</p>
<p>Apart from typing into vi or AC, he loves doing mathematics and philosophy. Other favorite subject of his include IT and physics. He seeks to study something along those lines in the future at some university. Other interests include various outdoor activities, enjoying the nature Finland has to offer.</p>
<p>Tachyon likes team games, especially CTF with Mumble. Screaming Tachyon doesn't bite, so join in! :-)</p>

</dl><p>The first real FPS that got Jay-EM into gaming was UT2004. It was published conveniently around the same time when he got his first computer as a Christmas present. After a couple of rounds his soul was gone and that game had him totally hooked. And just when he thought that gaming couldn't get any better, he tried a gamemode called instaCTF. Of course, he sucked and of course he was the worst player on the server in that mode, but that mode just completely overwhelmed him. And soon it was the only mode he ever wanted to play. Quickly he turned out to be one of the best players on the server and he managed to get to instaCTF's worldwide weekly Top 10 players' list every once in a while.</p>

<p>Then, a few years later he started to experience the GNU/Linux world and dropped gaming almost completely for over a year. Then he stumbled upon to a game named Sauerbraten from his friend's suggestion (you might know this "friend" as another w00pie, teppo) and noticed how similar it was to UT 2004 and then he was hooked again. Due to his solid insta-background, he was instantly one of the better players around there and gained immediately delight and disgust (and also some "omgwtfn00bhackercheater") from other players. He joined w00p around the same time that teppo and Majikal did also and from that point on, w00p's reign in the PSL games has been unstoppable. Lately he has become interested into Urban Terror and has been improving in it a lot (well, the starting level wasn't too good). </p>

</dl><p>Hirato can be considered a joker, a person who hardly takes things seriously. He will taunt and jest you about, often being offensive with his crude humour, without such intention. His pwneroring skills are excellent, as he will never leave a noob un-pwned, and wins over 80% of the matches he plays. He is very interested in computers, is learning to code in C. He is also a CubeScript wizard (if you remember to keep various shader commands and params out of the equation).</p>
<p>Like many, he has seen the light and switched to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>, but is still patiently waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd">GNU Hurd</a>.</p>
<p>He also is a GNU/Linux fanatic who refuses to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft">M$</a> products, and runs whatever he needs through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)">Wine</a> (if you could not tell).</p>
<p>In real life, Hirato is an aussie in a cruel and a dangerous winBSOD loving environment. He is unemployed, still going to school to further his education, so that he may become a computer engineer and create hardware that [temporarily] will only run on real OSes (hint: GNU/Linux and GNU Hurd).</p>
<p>He has some Sauerbraten expertise: pwning, <a href="http://quadropolis.us/node/967">mapping</a>, <a href="http://cube.wikispaces.com/Cubescript+Tutorial">CubeScript</a>, using shaders and creating some basic textures.</p>
<p>Hirato used to participate in gymnastics and notices that some people are on a verge of calling Hirato 'the abominable fruit monster', simply because he feeds only on fruit. He has a talent called '1 (4N 5P34k n00bs'</p>

</dl><p>Meatpie,<br>One of our main Australian Assault Cube players, started he started playing AC late 2006 when it was called "ActionCube". Mid-2007 he noticed the Woop clan and not too long after, he was welcomed into the community by Drakas, dazza and Rhubarb. These days he mainly focuses on using the sniper rifle in AC perfecting the head shot, but if the situation arises will change weapon to suit game-play.</p>
<p>In real life Meatpie enjoyed sex, drugs and rock'N'roll as a youngster and apparently has not changed too much since. Career-wise he has a trade certificate in screen printing and is experienced in graphic design and production management in the screen printing industry. Later on, he started a successful company in the pre-mixed concrete industry and now doesn't have so much work related stress. A loving partner and father of two girls are his priorities.</p>

</dl><p>Toca's first introduction to games was Pac-Man on the '1986 Atari 2006 jr VCS'. Years later with his introduction to an IBM's PS/2 PC and color graphics came his first PC games like Prince Of Persia, Out Of This World and Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.
Nowadays Toca likes to spend time playing Call Of Duty along with Grand Theft Auto, Half Life, Need For Speed, and some Simulation Games.</p>
<p>In the July of 2007, Toca saw a reference to a free game called Assault Cube. In the first
days of playing he got fragged and pwned maybe by some of today's best players in AC and didn't
play for about 2 months before giving the game a second try, but this time there was no turning back
- resistance to addiction was inevitable.</p>
<p>In real life, Toca's call of duty began as a computer technician, and when he got bored of fixing
others' problems, he started working as a DJ in a night club. Today Toca works as a freelancer
doing Video and Audio Editing for radio, TV and social events and likes to spend time mixing music
for local radio stations, and, of course pwning n00bs in AC.</p>

</dl><p>wut's computer life began in 1984 when his parents invested in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">Tandy Color Computer 2</a>. From this critical point on he was hooked.  Spending as much time in front of a keyboard eventually he had very little time to waste his mighty CPU power on trivial little programs such as games. Then id Software released <a href="http://nquake.com/">Quake</a>, and his computing life once again hit a critical juncture. Why waste processor capacity on mind-numbing number crunching and practical problem solving? Especially while just a few 
clicks of his new <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_Feb_14/ai_17983613">Logitech Mouseman 96</a> could turn wut from an unassuming teenage nerd into a state of the art, digital, fragging  machine with a taste for virtual blood.  A decade and change later and he is still fragging away.</p>
<p>However in the mean time wut does dabble in that useless practical side of computing, having had run own managed hosting business for a while, as well as dabbling in a little web development himself.  He has been an avid Linux/BSD advocate since the mid-90s when <a href="http://www.afterstep.org/">X</a> was about as fun to work with as a brain hemmorage.</p>
<p>To this day he still prefers to work in a pure console environment under Screen, with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi/m</a> the tool of his handicraft. </p>

</dl><p>It is all about music and ownage. Stanko is addicted to those two things. Every day, he will be giving his best every day to own, not just in real life, but also in AssaultCube and Urban Terror.</p>
<p>It all started 20 years ago and it has been going pretty well since. Stanko, for the first time, got his hands on a computer when he was four. It was a 286 and has so many good old games (sometimes you can catch Stanko playing them on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOSBox">DOSBox</a>). He became interested not just in games, but for the inner workings of computers as well.</p>
<p>So he started programming some minor stuff, and as the time goes by he is looooooving it more and more (especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</a>). Now he is at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Belgrade">University of Belgrade</a> studying his prolonged interest, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer science</a>.</p>
<p>In the begining his gaming skills was focused on logic and strategic games. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine">The Incredible Machine</a> is all time favourite of his. He played some classic FPSes like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake">Quake</a>, but only in single player; never too much.</p>
<p>AssaultCube was his first online FPS, and he was suprised that he is not the one who is getting pwned at public servers. Soon enough he came across few w00p members, and joined their IRC channel. The rest is history! Stanko accepted the offer to join uber skilled players of w00p. Not long ago he discovered Urban Terror and is pwning well on public!</p>
<p>Besides computers and music, he enjoy many things and has few hoobies. He likes socialising and has some pretty good friends, and likes hanging and having fun with them. He used to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_polo">water polo</a>, but was unable to continue due to a shoulder injury. He plays football and basketball with his friends as part of his recreation.</p>
<p>Stanko also has an artistic side: hand-made jewelry is one of his specialties. It is mostly made from metal (chainmail) and sometimes leather and few beads. His another hobby is drawing, with some "tattoo" style (planning to get a tattoo already due to the liking!). Some of his works can be seen on his web site.</p>
<p>There is too much to write when comes to music and Stanko's addiction to it. So, let's keep it short as possible: he likes rock and metal music, and his choices roam from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley">Elvis</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera">Pantera</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine">RATM</a>. Two all time favourites of his are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC">AC/DC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. Stanko likes too many bands (only the good ones) and it is fully addicted to music, listening it whole day long.</p>

<p>I'm currently at a law college. I'm a maniac for movies and books and I like to enjoy the silence of the dawn, where I can do all of these things peacefully.</p>
